# About Me
I am 6th-year Physics Ph.D candidate at the University of Kansas, where I am advised by [Dr. Allison Kirkpatrick](https://kirkpatrick.ku.edu/).

My research is primarily focused on the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. I am particularly interested in determining whether black hole mass assembly and star formation are truly coeval within individual galaxies. My recent work has been focused on [AGNBoost](https://github.com/hamblin-ku/AGNBoost), a probabilistic machine learning framework I have develeoped to both estimate photometric redshifts and identify AGN from JWST NIRCam + MIRI photometry, colors, and derived quantities. I am broadly very interested in machine learning methods, particularly distributional and bayesian methods that provide robust means of constraining prediction uncertainty. 

I grew up in Silver Spring, Maryland, and recevied my B.S. in physics from the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) in 2019, before moving to Lawrence, Kansas for graduate school. 

Outside of my academic life, I love star wars (watching and reading!), traditional archery, and performing my servant duties to my two pet rabbits [Yoda](/assets/img/Yoda.png) and [Andromeda](/assets/img/Andromeda.png).
