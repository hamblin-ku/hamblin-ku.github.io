I've given this workshop for at the for our REU students here at KU the past few years and figured it would make sense to post it here. This is supposed to serve as a casual introduction to machine learning for the summer students (who generally have some python experience). My general intent is to engage them in the topic while also de-mystifying the subject a bit. 

You can find the materials in this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/112MLkjuoajzMHIh5-CcxXuxOoe374KFJ?usp=drive_link). One of the notebook contains the "answers" for your reference. Please feel free to use and edit as you see fit!
