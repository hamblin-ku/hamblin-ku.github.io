# About
I am currently a second-year graduate student at the University of Kansas. I graduated from the University of Maryland Baltimore County with my B.S. in Physics in 2019. I'm primarily interested in Obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and have recently developed interests in machine-learning; you can read more about my past and current research below.

In my [Blog] I write about interesting articles in my field, written for a general audience. I also have useful code in Python in the [Code Snippets] section; these are little code tidbits I have found useful for my research over the years (making consistent and nice plots in LaTeX, interactive plots in Jupyter notebooks, etc.), as well as projects I have done that may be useful to other people.

# Research
## Undergraduate Work
Over the summer of 2017 I participated in the Yale SURF program, where I did research under Dr. Allison Kirkpatrick and Dr. Megan Urry. I used *Herschel* SPIRE $$250 \mu m$$ data to locate the most obscured AGN in the Stripe 82X survey, for which I compiled and fit spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using [AGN Fitter](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833...98C/abstract), a 4-component fit using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo. 

I continued this work over the summer of 2018 at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy under Dr. David Sanders, focusing on the most luminous AGN in the Stripe 82X survey. I discovered that the AGN was well split into two luminosity-bins: a high-luminosity bin exhibiting characteristics of broad-line QSO and a low-luminosity bin exhibiting characteristics of Seyfert and star-forming galaxies. This work was the subject of my poster presentation at the $$223^{rd}$$ American Astronomical Society (AAS) Conference and my oral presentation at the NASA Eyes symposium at the University of Kansas in 2019. 

## Graduate Work
Currently, I am working with [Dr. Allison Kirkpatrick] on the AGN and their relation to their host galaxies. My research over my first year involved the analysis of the obscuration of AGN from the CANDELS EGS field. I used PSFGAN to remove the AGN point source from HST WFC3 images, and calculated AGN and host galaxy fluxes, in order to determine if obscuration primarily arises from the host galaxy or the AGN. We were not able to conclude this work due to error introduced by the point-source removal using PSFGAN. I am also currently working with [Dr. Betsy Mills](https://mills.unit.ku.edu/) on the characterization of gas conditions in the vicinity of AGN using ALMA observations of nearby AGN.
